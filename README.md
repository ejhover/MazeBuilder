# Maze Generator and Robot Simulation

This project features a maze generation algorithm combined with a simple turtle graphics simulation, where a robot navigates through a dynamically generated maze. The maze is created using a backtracking algorithm, and the robot can be controlled using keyboard inputs.

## Features

- Generates a random maze using a backtracking algorithm.
- Visualizes the maze using Python's Turtle graphics.
- Allows user control of a robot that navigates through the maze using the `W`, `A`, `S`, and `D` keys.
- Resets the maze when the robot reaches the exit.

## Usage

1. Run Python Script
   ```bash
   python maze.py
